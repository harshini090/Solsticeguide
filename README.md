- # 🎥 Solstice Pod Quick Connect Guide

  ## From classroom transition → real-world impact 🚀

  The **College of Nursing at the University of Cincinnati** recently transitioned its classrooms to **Solstice Pods**, moving away from traditional classroom PCs.
   This meant **faculty now needed to bring their own devices** (Windows, macOS, or mobile) and connect wirelessly to project their screens.

  Sounds simple… but in reality:

  - Different devices = different steps
  - Faculty were confused, especially during live classes
  - Existing documentation was either missing or not user-friendly

  That’s where this project began.

  ------

  ## 💡 The Idea

  As someone who loves **designing things that don’t already exist** and making technology **easy for real users**, I decided to build a **clean, static, step-by-step web guide** that:

  - Clearly explains how to connect to a Solstice Pod
  - Separates instructions by **device type** (Windows / Mac / Mobile / PPT)
  - Works instantly in a browser (no installs, no logins)
  - Looks friendly, modern, and stress-free for faculty during class

  ## 🛠️ What I Built

  A **static web application** using:

  - **HTML** for structured, accessible content
  - **CSS** for a clean, readable UI (faculty-friendly, not “techy”)
  - **JavaScript** for simple interactivity and smooth navigation

  The guide focuses on:

  - Step-by-step clarity
  - Minimal cognitive load
  - Quick scanning during live teaching moments

  ## 🌱 What Happened Next (the exciting part ✨)

  The guide was so well-received that:

  - My **supervisors requested it to be expanded into a dynamic version**
  - The project is being transitioned from static documentation into a **maintainable, updatable site**
  - The website is moving under **College of Nursing ownership**
  - It will be officially used by faculty as part of classroom technology support

  Seeing something I designed become part of a real college workflow has been incredibly exciting and validating.

  ## 🎯 Why This Project Matters

  This project showcases:

  - **User-centered design** in a real academic environment
  - Translating complex technical systems into **simple visual guidance**
  - Frontend development with real users, constraints, and impact
  - Documentation that actually gets used

  It’s not just a website - it’s a solution that helps instructors teach without tech stress.

  ## 🙌 Final Thoughts

  This project reflects how I approach engineering and design:

  > build thoughtfully, design with empathy, and create things that make people’s lives easier.

  And honestly… I’m just getting started 💙
